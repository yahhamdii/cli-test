# Parser Creation Test

This test's goal is to evaluate your capacity at creating parsers. Parsers are samples of code that are designed to extract information from various sources. In that case you will have to extract information from an email's HTML that have been anonymised.

# How to do the test?

Run `yarn install` or `npm install`.

You are expected to write your code `main.js` in the root folder. Expected results are located in the `expectedResults.js` file.

You must use Vanilla JS and regex to extract information from samples. You have NOT access to the DOM (donâ€™t use window.getElementFromId for example)

To check your results when you're done run `yarn test` or `npm run test` depending on what tool you use.

All the test must pass in order for the test to be considered complete. We expect something that is legible and comprehensible by a regular software developper.

Good luck !
